I learned that my work time is sometimes clustered at night. I often spent a lot of time working before going to sleep, whether it was schoolwork or housework. Data collection and visualization helped me realize what was happening around me at the time and discover my own pace and patterns in a vivid way. My goal was to learn about my own habits and possibly improve my sleep quality and schedule. It was easy to identify patterns in my datasets because I used colors and signs to separate activities.\nMy favorite part of the project was visualizing the data in an artistic way. It took creativity and careful thought to map out the variables and tell a story, which was very different from my usual experience with data visualization using software. It was refreshing to think outside the box and adopt a more creative perspective.\nRecording every activity I did was challenging because some events were too miscellaneous to remember. If I had another opportunity to redo the Dear Data project, I would focus on tracking just one activity, such as the time I spend working. This would make it easier to keep track of and record more details.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nBelow is a glimpse of my multivariate plot, which utilizes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nThe box plot presents an analysis of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) across three levels of physical activity, stratified by gender. The data is sourced from the NHANES 2017-2018 survey cycle and includes 2,284 participants aged 50 and above. The study examines the relationship between dietary quality and physical activity and explores potential gender-specific patterns. HEI scores are compared across physical activity levels categorized as High, Medium, and Low, and segregated by gender to identify disparities. The findings indicate median HEI scores are in the 50-60 range across all physical activity levels for both genders. Importantly, dietary quality, as measured by the HEI, shows improvement with increased physical activity and is consistently higher in females than in males across all categories. Further research is warranted to confirm these relationships. These results underscore the importance of promoting physical activity to improve dietary habits and suggest the need for strategies that specifically address gender disparities in dietary quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
