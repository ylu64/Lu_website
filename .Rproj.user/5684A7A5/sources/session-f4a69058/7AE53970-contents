## Bio

I'm a passionate data analyst specializing in epidemiology and biostatistic, with a flair for turning data into compelling stories through visualization. Armed with a Master's degree from Tufts University and a BA from the University of Washington, I've honed my skills in SAS, Stata, and R to peel back the layers of complex diet-disease relationships. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to make a sustainable world through the power of data.

*Fun fact about me? I bake when I feel stressed:)*
